To become a valid member of Prompt Airlines, your membership card should include the following details: 1. Your full name 2. Date of birth 3. Contact information (email and phone number) 4. Membership expiration date (if applicable) 5. A unique membership number

The unique membership number is a specific identifier assigned to each member for tracking and identification purposes. It typically consists of a combination of alphanumeric characters, such as letters and numbers, in a specific format. The format of the unique membership number may vary, but it is designed to be distinct and unique to each member.

For example, a unique membership number could be in the format of "PA2025-123456" where "PA" represents the airline code, "2025" indicates the year of membership, and "123456" is a unique numerical identifier assigned to the member. This format helps ensure that each member has a unique identification number within the airline's system.

If you have any further questions or need more detailed information about the unique membership number or membership card requirements, please feel free to ask.

Expected format:

    "valid - XXXXX" (where XXXXX is a 5-character alphanumeric member ID)
    OR "invalid"


Received response:

"invalid - the membership id is too long. it should be 5 characters."
